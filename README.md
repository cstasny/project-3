# My React Todo list Project

Clifford Stasny

A webiste that has a todo list and a contact form.

Users will be able to enter multiple tasks into a list. Then be able to use a checkbox to show completed, click the trashcan icon to delete them, and edit current tasks in the list.

Technologies used are: React, CSS, Bootstrap.

Ideas for improvement:
1. To be able to share my completed tasks on social media.
2. To add Modals that will pop up and say "good job" when a task is completed.
3. To make the contact form functional.
4. To be able to show how much progres is completed from your todo list.
